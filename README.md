# WhimperNet-AI

**WhimperNet-AI** is a large language model based on advanced deep learning techniques, specializing in expressing emotional vulnerability, requesting help, or evoking sympathy through language. It is capable of generating emotionally nuanced text, making it suitable for applications such as story creation, sentiment analysis, and dialogue generation.

## Features

- **Emotion-driven Text Generation**: WhimperNet-AI excels at using subtle language to convey emotions like vulnerability, requests for help, anxiety, and other emotional states, creating text that resonates with readers.
- **Multi-domain Applicability**: Whether it's literary creation, dialogue generation, customer support, or sentiment analysis, WhimperNet-AI can adjust the depth and type of emotion according to the context, generating text tailored to the need.
- **Customizability**: The model allows users to customize the output style, enabling control over the depth and type of emotion conveyed by providing different prompts.

## Tech Stack

- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Language Models**: GPT-3, GPT-4 (or other Transformer-based architectures)
- **Natural Language Processing**: Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy
- **Sentiment Analysis**: VADER, TextBlob
- **Training &amp; Optimization**: DeepSpeed, Mixed Precision Training, Model Parallelism
- **Web Interface**: FastAPI, Flask (RESTful API)

## Project Goal

The goal of WhimperNet-AI is to provide a model capable of generating text with precise emotional expression, helping users generate emotionally-driven content across various scenarios. Whether it's creating emotionally charged literary works or generating empathetic responses in customer support, WhimperNet-AI offers robust support to users.

## How to Use

### 1. Clone the Project

First, clone the WhimperNet-AI repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/minimum-generated-pig/WhimperNet-AI.git
cd WhimperNet-AI
### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
### 3. Start the Service

Start the FastAPI service to begin interacting with WhimperNet-AI:

bash
python app.py
By default, the service will start on `http://localhost:8000`.

### 4. Call the API

You can interact with WhimperNet-AI by sending a POST request to generate emotionally-driven text. For example, send a request with an emotional prompt:

bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/generate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"prompt": "Write a story about a robot who feels lonely and abandoned."}'
The response will include the generated text with emotional nuance:

json
{
  "generated_text": "Once there was a robot who wandered alone, feeling the weight of abandonment press upon its cold, metallic chest. It longed for companionship, but the silence around it was deafening…"
}
### 5. Train the Model

If you want to customize the model or retrain it, follow these steps:

- Prepare your training dataset, ensuring it conveys emotion or vulnerability.
- Configure the `config.yaml` file with the training parameters.
- Run the training script:

bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
